# Agent Instructions

- Always run builds for debug and release configurations to ensure there are no errors or warnings. Build commands generate extensive output, so use `tail` to confirm the build result.

- Always run tests to ensure there are no failing tests.

- Never push and tag without the developer's explicit request to do so.
